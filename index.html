		<div id="description"> I was born in Winnipeg, MB and raised in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Some of my favorite things to do include traveling the world, outdoor activities like skiing and snowboarding, as well as baking (even if it doesn't always go well). I spent this past summer studying strategic management at the London School of Economics as well as taking my MCAT and applying to medical school. In my spare time, I also love reading, hanging out with friends, trying new restaurants, volunteering and running. I recently received my first medical school acceptance so I'm extremely excited about that! I've had a great experience through the, Web Design Decal, I wish you all the best of luck next semester! </div>
